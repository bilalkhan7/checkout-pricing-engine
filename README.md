# Checkout Pricing Engine – Angular 20 (Standalone Components + Signals + Playwright)

This project is an implementation of the **Supermarket Checkout Kata**, built using **Angular 20**, **standalone components**, **signals**, **RxJS**, **unit tests**, and **Playwright E2E tests**.

---

# Problem Statement

Implement a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of scanned items:

- Every item has a **unit price** which can change frequently.
- Some items have **weekly offers** (e.g., “Apple: 30 each OR 2 for 45”).
- Items can be scanned **in any order**, and the discount must be applied if the required quantity is reached.

Example:

| Item   | Unit Price | Offer         |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Apple  | 30         | 2 for 45       |
| Banana | 50         | 3 for 130      |
| Peach  | 60         | —              |
| Kiwi   | 20         | —              |

Scanning **Apple → Banana → Apple** should apply the **2 for 45€** offer automatically.

# Tech Stack

- **Angular 20** (Standalone components + Signals)
- **TypeScript**
- **RxJS**
- **Karma + Jasmine** for unit testing
- **Playwright** for E2E testing
- **MockAPI.io** for product + offer APIs (selected and setup for showcasing the ability to consume real APIs)

# Data Loading (Optimistic + Cached)

The system loads:

### Products  
`ProductService.loadProducts()`

### Offers  
`OfferService.loadOffers()`

### Combined Pricing Table  
`PricingService.loadPricing()`

All services:

- Use **fallbacks** to `DEFAULT_PRICING_TABLE` when the API is down
- Use **shareReplay** for caching

---

# UI Features

## Products Page
- Cards showing name, price, and offer state
- Offer badges:
  - **Active this week**
  - **Upcoming**
  - **Recently expired**
- “Add to cart”
- Quantity dropdown
- Client-side pagination
- Sorting filters
- Disabled “Proceed to Cart” when cart is empty

## Checkout Page
- Basket grouped by SKU
- Quantity increment/decrement
- Remove item button
- Offer indicator in totals
- Final summary (subtotal, discount, total)
- Mock “Proceed to payment” → success message
